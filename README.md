This is a full-stack framework project built using Django, HTML, CSS and Python. My objective is to create a functioning and responsive website, that allows users to post, comment and like or unlike recipes. This project is based around the functionallity of CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete. 

I wanted to build a Recipe page because I enjoy cooking and sharing recipes that I have created for my freinds and family. I wanted to create an simple platform for user to use. 
Simple but effective 

## About 

The Home|Cooking page is a website where users can view recipes, like, Comment and and also share their own recipes with other users. This page is intended for any one who enjoys cooking and is looking for some inspiration.

# Deployment 

## Gitpod 

To create a new repository I took the following steps:

1. Logged into Github.
2. Click on the ‘repositories’ section.
3. Repository template - I used the code institute template.
4. Clicked the green ‘new’ button, creates new repository page.
6. Once created I opened the new repository and clicked the green ‘Gitpod’ button to create a workspace in Gitpod for editing.

## Heroku

To deploy this page to Heroku from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

1. Create the Heroku App:
   - Select "Create new app" in Heroku.
   - Choose a name for your app and select the location.

2. Attach the Postgres database:
   - In the Resources tab, under add-ons, type in Postgres and select the Heroku Postgres option.

3. Prepare the environment and settings.py file:
- In the Settings tab, click on Reveal Config Vars and copy the url next to DATABASE_URL.
- In your GitPod workspace, create an env.py file in the main directory.
- Add the DATABASE_URL value and your chosen SECRET_KEY value to the env.py file.
- Add the SECRET_KEY value to the Config Vars in Heroku.
- Update the settings.py file to import the env file and add the SECRETKEY and DATABASE_URL file paths.
- Update the Config Vars with the Cloudinary url, adding into the settings.py file also.
- In settings.py add the following sections:
  * Cloudinary to the INSTALLED_APPS list
  * STATICFILE_STORAGE
  * STATICFILES_DIRS
  * STATIC_ROOT
  * MEDIA_URL
  * DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE
  * TEMPLATES_DIR
  * Update DIRS in TEMPLATES with TEMPLATES_DIR
  * Update ALLOWED_HOSTS with ['app_name.heroku.com', 'localhost']

4. Store Static and Media files in Cloudinary and Deploy to Heroku:
- Create three directories in the main directory; media, storage and templates.
- Create a file named "Procfile" in the main directory and add the following:
web: gunicorn project-name.wsgi
- Log in to Heroku using the terminal heroku login -i.
- Then run the following command: heroku git:remote -a your_app_name_here and replace your_app_name_here with the name of your Heroku app. This will link the app to your Gitpod terminal.
- After linking your app to your workspace, you can then deploy new versions of the app by running the command git push heroku main and your app will be deployed to Heroku.
