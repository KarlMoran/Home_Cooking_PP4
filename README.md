This is a full-stack framework project built using Django, HTML, CSS and Python. My objective is to create a functioning and responsive website, that allows users to post, comment and like or unlike recipes. This project is based around the functionallity of CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete. 

## About 

The Home|Cooking page is a website where users can view recipes, like, Comment and and also share their own recipes with other users. This page is intended for any one who enjoys cooking and is looking for some inspiration.
